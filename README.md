#LYRICS


## "The Country Club Sandwiches"

**V1**
It's early-evenin' Tuesday night, 'bout 7ben - 8 o'clock
And I'm headin' to the honky tonk to get a little hot.
When I busted through the swangin' door well whom all did I hear?
It 'twas the Country Club a-Sammiches gettin' into gear!

**Chorus**
They's the Country Club a' Sammiches and Lordy how they swing!
They's the Country Club a' Sammiches and can't you hear 'em sing?
They sing, "Billy-Bobby, Dave 'n Robby Jimmy-John and Bob!
We's the Country Club a' Sammiches, come get us while we're hot!"

**Guitar Break**

**V2**
Well it didn't take me long to get my dayncin' shoes on tight
And the jelly from the sammich band was fillin' me just right.
I said, "Howdy boys, I came from town - I heard you're good with cheese?"
They said, "Step up to our counter son we'll fill your gut with ease!"

**Chorus**

**Bridge**
Well it sure do take a polished man to blend a meal just so,
But these old boys from Deliville can make you doe-si-doe.
With their market fresh ingredients of country, rock and soul,
Their ain't a palate near or far that can resist their roooooooooooool!

**V3**
By the time the boys were finally done my spirit was restored,
And the gal I had across my arm, her feets was mighty sore!
But the yummy-comfort deli feeling lingered on and on,
And as I drifted off to sleep I heard their tasty song!

**Chorus**

**Outro Testimony**



## "Last Night the Bottle Came to Town"

**V1**
Last night the bottle came to town
Whiskey was my only friend around
Inside a bar where no one's found
A drink poured neat kept me safe and sound

**V2**
I used to never run around
Cause you were the only game in town
You were closer than my kin
But now I drink alone again

**Chorus**
And the only thing to do
Is pour another one for you
There's nothing you could say
To make this pain go away
Last night the bottle came to town

**Solo**

**V3**
I saved my mama's wedding ring
Now that doesn't mean a thing
All the that time all those plans
Now it'll touch your hand



## "If He Breaks Your Heart"

**Chorus**
If he breaks your heart...can I lick the wound?
I've tried to keep my distance, settin' here across the room.
I can see it in his face, he'll be leavin' you so soon,
So when he breaks your heart, can I lick the wound?

**V1**
The two of you walked in here hand in hand,
But when the band stopped playin' he got mad.
You've tried to calm him down, leadin' him towards the door.
But his face is turnin' red, and he wants to settle a score.

**Chorus**

**V2**
Sometimes a man gets set in his ways,
And yours looks he's had one of those days.
He wanted one more song, but the band refused to play.
So he broke off his bottle, and walked up towards the stage.

**Guitar Solo**

**V3**
That drummer seen him comin', and guessed his ruse.
But your man was whiskey-bent with nothin' to lose.
He put his finger to the drummer's chest...and you can prolly guess the rest.
His bloodied mouth was facin' North, and his crooked nose was facin' West!

**Chorus**
If he breaks your heart...can I lick the wound?
I've tried to keep my distance, settin' here across the room.
I can see it in his face, he'll be walkin' out on you,
So when he breaks your heart, can I lick the wound?



## "Can't Get No Service (In This Baptist Church)"

**V1**
I can't get no service in this dadburn Baptist church!
My deevice says I got two bars but I cain't Google search.
Preacher's ramblin' on and on 'bout a deevine heaben'ly place,
While the Saints are just now kickin' off and there's a big-ole Sprint Car race!

**Chorus**
I come ev'ry Sunday to receive the perfect Word,
When the Good Book is a' streamin' t'won't no prophesy be heard!
The Deacon says the online world holds a host 'a sin,
But the sweetest words I ever saw 'twas the password - "Jesus Lives!"

**V2**
Genesis, Exodus, Numbers, Acts and 'ole Deuteronomy
But the 'ole Good Book got it wrong when it forgot DirecTV!
My batt'ry is a'runnin' low, you might call me a quitter,
'Cause my head's spinnin' all around and mind's all a-twitter!

**Chorus**




## "I Saw a Picture of You Dancing"

**V1**
Baby! I saw a picture of you dancing!
Maybe! I could do a dance with you.
Crazy! I'm in the mood for some romancin'!
Baby! Let's get you in your dancin' shoes.

**Chorus**
We can roll inside, or step out in the weather,
It don't matter sugar if we're dancin' together!

**Guitar Break**

**V2**
Honey! I saw a picture of you smiling!
Ain't it Funny! I'd like to tell a joke or tow to you.
Sunny! With you I'd walk a country mile and
Honey! We could share a laugh or two.

**Chorus**

**Guitar Break**

**Chorus**

**Outro Boy!**




## "She's Just a String on His Guitar"
* Note: David Jennings objected to the use of the Maj7 chord at the end of this song, but the producer demanded it.

**V1**
She was gone again this mornin' and I know exactly where she's bound.
Last night there were promises, but now her picture's all that's found
Where here boots were laid at midnight there's an emptiness I know
He's got a gig tonight in Reno and she'll be waitin' at the show.

**Chorus**
'Cause he's the one who winds her
And he don't really mind her
He cuts her when she gets too long,
I clean her when her welcome's warn
He plays her every night, makes a dollar in his jar.
Just a string on his guitar, good Lord, just a string on his guitar.

**V2**
Monday morning comes and she's back to me again
Says not a word about it, just quietly walks on in.
There's a silent understanding, between her soul and mine,
And though we lie together, it's only me who cries.

**Solo**

**Chorus**
